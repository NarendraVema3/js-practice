EXPLANATION :-
 
   1)  In java script var behaves like a data type and it's a global variable 
   2)  all the above variables are innitialized variables 
        
         what is the meaning of innitialized varibles and declarative variables ?
         
         A) -> decarative variable is nothig but the is just declare the varible type
             
              Example:-
              //  below example belongs to declaration process
              
              var FirstName = String;
              
             -> initialization is nothing but the innitiate satine value to the to the varibale immediatle 
                
                Example:- 
                
                // below exaple is for the innitialize variable 
                
                 var number = 9989166691 ;// number type
